## Code Architecture & quality 

**THIS IS A FAR FROM PERFECT CODEBASE** and it doesn't matter. I'm not releasing it because I want to show my C# skill, instead I want to show what a released game looks like inside: complex, some dead code (but some dead code is link to the "tiny" part), lots of code that could be refactored, scrap from previous projects... 

Now, with Flipon I wanted to avoid using Unity's scene as much as possible except for the UI. That's why the `Game` scene doesn't display anything when not running: everything is created on Play.

I also wanted to have a testable independant C# project for the `Core`. That's why you have `Block` (core) and `BlockScript` (Unity MonoBehaviour).
Turns out it wasn't a great idea, but I did manage to have Unit tests for most of that part. Also it could be reused in ahything else (ML, Flipon 99 players online, whatever).

BUT in the end a lot of game logic also happen in `PonGameScript` and `GridScript` (like chain detection), so it is far from perfect.

## How to run

Open the project in [Unity](unity3d.com/) (2019.4.0f18).

Open the `Game` scene.

Play. It should run.

Now you can tweak the `GAME SETTINGS` GameObject to change players, objectives, grid size, speed, etc.

Join the [official Flipon discord](https://discord.gg/7jFZ2fC) if you have any question about the game or the code, it's your best chance to get a quick answer. 

## Contributing

The gameplay code is this repository is the same than in the game.
If you want to make a significant modification or addition, I may or may not add it in the final game. If so, I'll indeed properly credits your work.

There's a `.DotSettings` file for Rider/Omnisharp if you want to follow the coding style of the prokject.

Note: I use as much Gitmoji as possible my commit messages.
